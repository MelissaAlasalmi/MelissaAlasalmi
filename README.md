### Hi there 👋

I'm an international content manager turned coder - currently studying programming independently and at Hive Helsinki. I’m working on projects that combine web app development and algorithms to build tools for positive, sustainable impact.

## Currently: 
📚 learning web development with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**

📚 learning imperative programming with **algorithms projects in C**  

## Next up: 
📣 **your stack here!** I'm currently looking for a junior developer position. If you think I might be a good fit for your team, I would be glad to spend a few months learning your tech before my first day at work!

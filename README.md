### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an international content manager turned coder - currently studying at Hive Helsinki. At Hive, we have a broad and flexible student-led curriculum. Iâ€™m pursuing a combination of WebDev and AI/Algorithms projects, and it's important to me that my work involves positive, sustainable impact.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **lem_in** - an algorithm that finds the quickest way to get a specified number of 'ants' across an 'ant farm' in as few turns as possible. To do so, the ants will need to avoid traffic jams, as well as walking all over each other. Each checkpoint, with the exeption of the starting and finishing point, can only contain a single ant at a time.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about **Data Structures and Algorithms in C, MongoDB, PHP, and basics of front-end**.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that align with **SDGs 4, 8, and 10**.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about empathy-based skills training, solving the SDGs, and combining our superpowers for a better tomorrow.

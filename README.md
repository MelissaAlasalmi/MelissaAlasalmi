### Hi there 👋

I'm an international content manager turned coder - currently studying programming independently and at Hive Helsinki. I’m pursuing a combination of WebDev and AI/Algorithms projects, and it's important to me that my work involves positive, sustainable impact.

- 📚 Currently: building a personal site with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**
- 🔭 Next up: building a web app that shows how balanced your actions are towards all the SDGs, based on your daily choices - using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL**
- 🎓 At school: projects surrounding **algorithms in C**.
- 💬 Ask me about: pedagogy, solving the SDGs, and how we can combine our superpowers for a better tomorrow.
- 💡 Teach me about: all things data and web-based AI.
- 📫 Ping me: melissa.alasalmi@gmail.com

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an international content manager turned coder - currently studying at Hive Helsinki. At Hive, we have a broad and flexible student-led curriculum. Iâ€™m pursuing a combination of WebDev and AI/Algorithms projects, and it's important to me that my work involves positive, sustainable impact.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **ft_printf.c** - my own printf coded from scratch!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about **Data Structures and Algorithms in C**.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that align with **SDGs 5, 8, and 10**.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about empathy-based skills training, solving the SDGs, and combining our superpowers for a better tomorrow.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: melissa.alasalmi@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: My back squat one-rep max record is 95 kilos!
